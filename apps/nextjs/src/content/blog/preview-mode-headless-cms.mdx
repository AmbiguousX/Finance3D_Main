<Callout>
  We all want to be in the right place at the right time. Why do some have such good luck and others not so much? Is it possible to steer the fortunes of fate to our favor through use of will?
</Callout>

The ideas of fate and luck have been around for an exceptionally long time. We can say a person has good luck when they benefit from situations that involve randomness. We can now ask: do you have to be lucky to be lucky? or can luck be approached scientifically?

The idea of luck itself is so nebulous that no serious scientific hypothesis could be tested to demonstrate if the metaphysical quality of luck is real. However, when one properly understands the environment they are working within, they can modify their behavior to increase the probability of being correct...or lucky (are they not the same thing?)

Financial markets are an excellent avenue to test if certain behaviors can be taken to increase the chance of being correct (lucky). It is very important to mention here that there are certain markets where behavior modification will not increase the probability of being lucky at all. In an environment like a casino, the odds of all the games played are known and fixed. Casino probabilities are as iron clad as the law of gravity.

The evidence of the sheer conistency of casino probability odds is clear as day. Las Vegas casinos are profitable. The house always wins. Comparatively, the probability of a financial market maker going busto is not zero like it is for the casino. In fact, the probability of going bust is quite high. The federal reserve bank has had to step in multiple times to clean up liquidity crises. Has a central bank ever had to bail out a casino?

> It should now be quite clear that financial markets do not have the same level of risk as casino games. The thing is, nearly all of contemporary statistical finance is based on the axiom that financial markets do have similar probablity to casino games.
> The realization that financial markets are statistically different that casino markets is bittersweet. On the one end it allows for the willful creation of good luck while at the same time maximzing pain for bad luck. Wnile it will remain forever true that markets are not predictiable, there are better tools avialable for understanding the market than typical bell curve static statistics.
> The market is a living creature. A dynamic force of nature. It must be analyzed as a living being. 

The `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin is our attempt to give you what you _actually_ want, without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base styles.

It adds a new `prose` class that you can slap on any block of vanilla HTML content and turn it into a beautiful, well-formatted document:

```html
<article class="prose">
  <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
  <p>
    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread
    with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an iconic status
    in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm, cheesy loaf for
    Halloween.
  </p>
  <p>
    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a
    series of rabies cases springing up around the country.

## What to expect from here on out

What follows from here is just a bunch of absolute nonsense I've written to dogfood the plugin itself. It includes every sensible typographic element I could think of, like **bold text**, unordered lists, ordered lists, code blocks, block quotes, _and even italics_.

It's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:

1.  We want everything to look good out of the box.
2.  Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.
3.  Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with two items.

Now we're going to try out another header style.

### Typography should be easy

So that's a header for you — with any luck if we've done our job correctly that will look pretty reasonable.

Something a wise person once told me about typography is:

> Typography is pretty important if you don't want your stuff to look like trash. Make it good then it won't be bad.

It's probably important that images look okay here by default as well:

<Image
  src="/images/blog/blog-post-4.jpg"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.

Now I'm going to show you an example of an unordered list to make sure that looks good, too:

- So here is the first item in this list.
- In this example we're keeping the items short.
- Later, we'll use longer, more complex list items.

And that's the end of this section.

## What if we stack headings?

### We should make sure that looks good, too.

Sometimes you have headings directly underneath each other. In those cases you often have to undo the top margin on the second heading because it usually looks better for the headings to be closer together than a paragraph followed by a heading should be.

### When a heading comes after a paragraph …

When a heading comes after a paragraph, we need a bit more space, like I already mentioned above. Now let's see what a more complex list would look like.

- **I often do this thing where list items have headings.**

For some reason I think this looks cool which is unfortunate because it's pretty annoying to get the styles right.

I often have two or three paragraphs in these list items, too, so the hard part is getting the spacing between the paragraphs, list item heading, and separate list items to all make sense. Pretty tough honestly, you could make a strong argument that you just shouldn't write this way.

- **Since this is a list, I need at least two items.**

I explained what I'm doing already in the previous list item, but a list wouldn't be a list if it only had one item, and we really want this to look realistic. That's why I've added this second list item so I actually have something to look at when writing the styles.

- **It's not a bad idea to add a third item either.**

I think it probably would've been fine to just use two items but three is definitely not worse, and since I seem to be having no trouble making up arbitrary things to type, I might as well include it.

After this sort of list I usually have a closing statement or paragraph, because it kinda looks weird jumping right to a heading.

## Code should look okay by default.

I think most people are going to use [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) or [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) or something if they want to style their code blocks but it wouldn't hurt to make them look _okay_ out of the box, even with no syntax highlighting.

Here's what a default `tailwind.config.js` file looks like at the time of writing:

```js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
};
```

Hopefully that looks good enough to you.

### What about nested lists?

Nested lists basically always look bad which is why editors like Medium don't even let you do it, but I guess since some of you goofballs are going to do it we have to carry the burden of at least making it work.

1.  **Nested lists are rarely a good idea.**

- You might feel like you are being really "organized" or something but you are just creating a gross shape on the screen that is hard to read.
- Nested navigation in UIs is a bad idea too, keep things as flat as possible.
- Nesting tons of folders in your source code is also not helpful.

2.  **Since we need to have more items, here's another one.**

- I'm not sure if we'll bother styling more than two levels deep.
- Two is already too much, three is guaranteed to be a bad idea.
- If you nest four levels deep you belong in prison.

3.  **Two items isn't really a list, three is good though.**

- Again please don't nest lists if you want people to actually read your content.
- Nobody wants to look at this.
- I'm upset that we even have to bother styling this.

The most annoying thing about lists in Markdown is that `<li>` elements aren't given a child `<p>` tag unless there are multiple paragraphs in the list item. That means I have to worry about styling that annoying situation too.

- **For example, here's another nested list.**

But this time with a second paragraph.

- These list items won't have `<p>` tags
- Because they are only one line each

- **But in this second top-level list item, they will.**

This is especially annoying because of the spacing on this paragraph.

- As you can see here, because I've added a second line, this list item now has a `<p>` tag.

This is the second line I'm talking about by the way.

- Finally here's another list item so it's more like a list.

- A closing list item, but with no nested list, because why not?

And finally a sentence to close off this section.
